# CP1404/5632 Assignment: Reading List by Lum Kwan Wei Brandon

Assignment two requires a creation of a GUI version of the program made in Assignment one.
In the creation of the GUI, I have learnt to create and implement classes, as well as adapting the python code to include Kivy.

Reading list application.
As per assignment instructions, this file contains a program that creates a GUI when run.
Users will be able to select books to mark as completed and completed book details by clicking corresponding buttons.
Users will also be able to add books by inputing the details into the text fields.
Upon exit, the details of the books and any changes will be saved in the books.csv file.

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
With most of the base functionality done during assignment one, the entire project took me about one to two weeks to complete.
This is not reflective of my github version control, as certain ideas were penned on paper and considered before implementation.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The complete functionality of the program, as per stated in the assignment task details.
I am also satisfied with my adaptation of the Kivy toolkit, as it seemed daunting initially.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Time wasted on the starting process of the assignment. I had created most of the inital code on the main.py itself,
before realising i needed to make use classes to create methods to implement certain functionality.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The trial and error process. Personally, I learn better through a practical experience.
This assignment has allowed me to do so, as I am constantly referring to given and sourced materials to implement
features successfully.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I would be creating the classes and methods first, based on the required features. This will allow me to build
the main body of code easily, rather than having to keep working backwards, adding lines of code every time I hit
a road block.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
Resources given by the school and lecturer were more than sufficient to complete the assignment.
These included Kivy demos, lecture slides (Basis of the concepts) as well as answers given on website Stackoverflow.
Through a process of trial and error, I was able to adapt the ideas from coding examples for my own context.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The only main challenge that I faced was the concept of classes. I had trouble understanding how to create methods,
how to call them and how they should be incorporated into the main body of code. It was the reason why I tried to
finish the assignment solely on the main itself, relying on complete functionality to justify my actions.

Luckily for me, the lecturer and tutor are patient in clarifying the key concept with me. I also had a peer who
spent some of his time to use examples to teach me how to write and implement classes with ease. He helped me
understand how to shift certain functions into classes to be called upon, reducing the complexity of the main code.
